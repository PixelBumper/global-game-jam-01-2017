# global-game-jam-01-2017


## Requirements
Unity 5.5.0f3


## Avoiding merge issues in meta files
1. Always create a prefab for each gameobject in the scene
2. Ensure that there is at most one person working on a prefab
3. Ensure that there is at most one person working on each game scene

    -> if you need one of the scenes to adjust a prefab, create a copy of that scene

    -> save prefabs changes by clicking the apply button
    

## Recomendations
use Project Rider :)
